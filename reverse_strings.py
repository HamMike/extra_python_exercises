# Reverse Strings in a Sentence

# Given a string, implement a program that will reverse the order of the characters
# in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespaces and initial word order.

# Example:
# Input: "Let's do a coding challenge"
# Output: "s'teL od a gniedoc egnellahc"


# *** your code here ***
string = input("Type something:")
print(string[::-1])
